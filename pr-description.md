## Summary

This PR adds comprehensive end-to-end (E2E) tests for the course enrollment flow using Playwright. The tests cover the critical purchase path to catch regressions automatically and ensure a reliable user experience.

## Changes Made

### E2E Test Suite (e2e/enrollment.spec.ts)

1. **Full Enrollment Flow Test**
   - Navigate to course page
   - Click "Enroll Now" button
   - Proceed to checkout
   - Complete mock payment
   - Verify enrolled course appears in dashboard

2. **Promo Code Test**
   - Apply promo code (WELCOME20 for 20% off)
   - Verify discount is calculated correctly
   - Check discounted price is displayed

3. **Dashboard Verification Test**
   - Verify enrolled courses appear in dashboard
   - Check course card structure

4. **Course Detail Page Test**
   - Verify course title, instructor, pricing, and category display
   - Confirm enroll button is present

5. **Course Listing Test**
   - Verify courses page loads correctly
   - Check course cards are rendered

6. **Dashboard Navigation Test**
   - Verify dashboard loads
   - Check navigation to "My Courses" section

### Test Fixtures (e2e/fixtures/course.ts)

- **Mock Courses**: React Fundamentals, Advanced React, TypeScript Mastery with realistic pricing and metadata
- **Mock Promo Codes**: WELCOME20 (20% off), SAVE10 (10% off), FLAT25 ($25 off)
- **Shared Helpers**: Navigation functions and promo code application utilities

### Configuration (playwright.config.ts)

- Multi-browser support: Chromium, Firefox, Safari, and mobile browsers (Pixel 5, iPhone 12)
- Web server configuration for local dev server (npm run dev)
- Trace and video recording on test failure
- Retry configuration for CI environments

## Technical Details

- All API calls are mocked to avoid real transactions
- Tests run against local dev server (http://localhost:3001)
- Proper wait strategies for network idle and URL changes
- Accessible element queries using role-based selectors
- Tests are isolated with beforeEach cleanup

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install Playwright browsers
npx playwright install

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run with UI mode
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

All tests are designed to run in CI without real API calls, ensuring reliable and fast execution.
